=JOHN FISKE BARNARD, M. Am. Soc. C. E.=[1]

[1] Memoir prepared by W. K. Barnard, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.

DIED FEBRUARY 6TH, 1910.

John Fiske Barnard was born in Worcester, Mass., on April 23d. 1829. He
was graduated from the Bridgewater Normal School, and from Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute.

In November, 1850, Mr. Barnard entered the railway service. He
held various engineering and operating positions with the Grand Trunk
Railway and its subsidiary lines in Lower Canada, and served as Chief
Engineer of the Grand Trunk South of the St. Lawrence River for the
last three years of his connection with that road.

In May, 1869, he went to the Missouri Valley Railroad as Superintendent
and Chief Engineer. During the same year he was appointed Chief
Engineer of the Kansas City-St. Joseph and Council Bluffs Railroad,
and remained with this road and the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad
(both now a part of the Burlington Missouri Lines), as Chief Engineer,
General Superintendent, and General Manager, until 1886. During this
time Mr. Barnard was also President of the Atchison Union Depot Company
and the St. Joseph Union Stock Yards Company, Secretary and Treasurer
of the St. Joseph Depot Company, and Director in various railroad
companies.

In 1886, Mr. Barnard was appointed President and General Manager of
the Ohio and Mississippi Railway, which position he occupied until
1892. From that time until 1893, he was engaged on several reports
of projected railroads and appraisals of industrial and railroad
properties.

From 1893 to 1898, Mr. Barnard was Receiver of the Omaha and St. Louis
(now Wabash) Railway, during part of which time he was also President
of the Alton Bridge Company, and Receiver of the St. Clair-Madison and
St. Louis Belt Line.

In the spring of 1905 he moved to Los Angeles, Cal., where he lived
until February 6th, 1910, when, after an illness of several months, he
died at his home at the age of 81 years.

Mr. Barnard was elected a Member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers on September 1st, 1880. He was also a Member of the American
Geographical Society.


=ROBERT L. ENGLE, M. Am. Soc. C. E.=[2]

[2] Memoir prepared by O. E. Selby, Jun. Am. Soc. C. E.

DIED OCTOBER 16TH, 1909.

Robert L. Engle was born on December 5th, 1846. He was a product of
the time when opportunities for technical training were few, so that
his engineering education was gained largely by contact with actual
work. He began his professional career after the Civil War, in which
he served for two years in the One Hundred and Forty-eighth Indiana
Volunteer Infantry.

The first construction work of any note on which Mr. Engle was engaged
was the building of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, now a part of
the Baltimore and Ohio System, extending from Cincinnati to St. Louis.
Later, and up to 1878, he was connected with the construction of the
Cincinnati Southern Railway, Cincinnati's municipally owned railway,
as Division Engineer, at Ray Springs, Tenn. This work included several
tunnels and other heavy work in the mountain territory.

After the completion of the Cincinnati Southern, Mr. Engle went West,
and was engaged in the construction of the Santa Fé Railroad at
Trinidad, Colo., in the capacity of Assistant Chief Engineer. Under
his direction the Royal Gorge Hanging Bridge was built, and much other
interesting work was carried out. Mr. Engle's forte was location, and
in the mountainous regions of the West he found ample exercise for this
faculty. From Trinidad he moved to Santa Fé, N. Mex. His name is borne
by Engle, N. Mex., now a thriving Western town.

While still in the West, Mr. Engle was connected with the Mexican
Central Railroad, at Chihuahua, Mexico, on construction work, and with
the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. It is thus seen that he played
a part in much of the important pioneer railroad development of the
mountain region of the West.

In 1885, Mr. Engle began work on the location and construction of the
Chicago, Burlington, and Northern Railroad, now part of the Burlington
System, being located at St. Paul, Minn., as Assistant Chief Engineer
of that portion of the line north of La Crosse, Wis. Later, his
jurisdiction included the whole line. During 1887 and a part of 1888,
he had charge of the construction of the Illinois Valley and Northern
Railroad, as Chief Engineer, at La Salle, Ill. In the latter part of
1888 he conducted surveys for coal branch lines connecting with the
Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, in the mountains of West Virginia.

Beginning in September, 1889, Mr. Engle was Resident Engineer on the
construction of the Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge over the Ohio
River. During his term of service the substructure, involving several
deep pneumatic foundations, was built, and parts of the approaches
were erected. During his stay at Louisville Mr. Engle was selected as
Arbitrator in a matter of disputed classification between the company
and the contractor for the Pike's Peak Rack Railroad, and effected a
satisfactory settlement. Among other things his later service included
location work on the Tennessee Central Railroad, in 1892; location
and construction work for the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad, in
Arkansas; and construction work on the Tidewater Railroad, now the
Virginian Railway, at Princeton, W. Va. At the time of his death he was
employed as Engineer for the contracting firm of Carpenter and Boxley,
at Johnson City, Tenn.

With the death of Robert L. Engle, the Profession loses one of those
sturdy, self-made engineers, to whom the country is largely indebted
for pushing railroad construction overland and through the West. In
character, rugged like the mountains with which he was associated,
he was still the gentlest of souls to those associated with him in
subordinate capacities. The writer knew him as Chief and friend for
many years, and cannot recall any departures from the lines of the
highest dignity, rectitude, good habits, and good nature.

Mr. Engle was a Member of the Engineers' Club of Cincinnati from the
time of its organization. He maintained his home in Cincinnati for
twenty-one years, while his engagements kept him at various other
places.

On February 20th, 1879, Mr. Engle married Miss Sallie McQueety, of
Cincinnati, and is survived by her and their son and two daughters.
His family and social relations were most happy, although his enforced
absences from home kept him from much of the social contact which his
qualities deserved.

Mr. Engle was elected a Member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers on September 7th, 1881.


=CHARLES HERBERT DEANS, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.=[3]

[3]Memoir prepared by Emil Diebitsch and Edwin S. Jarrett, Members, Am.
Soc. C. E.

DIED MARCH 7TH, 1909.

Charles Herbert Deans was born in Chester, Delaware County, Pa., on
November 30th, 1863, and died at his home in Ph[oe]nixville, Pa., on
March 7th, 1909.

His father, Charles Woodbury Deans, was prominent in educational work,
and was active in the early organization and in the popularization of
the Common School System of the State of Pennsylvania.

On his father's side Mr. Deans was descended from the Deans and
Sterling families, who, immediately following the War of the
Revolution, emigrated from Connecticut to Susquehanna and Wyoming
Counties, Pennsylvania. His mother was Priscilla Lyons Williams, of
Chester, Delaware County, Pa., who was descended from the Lyons family
of New Jersey and the Williams and Pennell families of Pennsylvania.

From both his father and his mother Mr. Deans inherited a taste and
aptitude for study. His youthful environment was among books and in an
atmosphere which naturally encouraged the desire he early formed to fit
himself for a professional life.

His education was begun in private schools, but later he attended
the public schools, and was graduated from the High School at
Ph[oe]nixville, Pa., in 1881. He spent the next four years in practical
work, learning business methods, becoming an excellent and accurate
accountant, and familiarizing himself, in the works of the Ph[oe]nix
Iron Company, with mill and shop methods and practice, and the
metallurgy of iron and steel.

In 1885, Mr. Deans entered Lehigh University, well prepared in his
studies, with a mind ripe for the absorption of further knowledge, and
a temperament for enjoying to the utmost the four years of University
life before him. He was a good student, standing well up in the first
quarter of his class. He was elected a member of Theta Delta Chi
Fraternity, was one of the Editors and Assistant Business Manager of
the college Annual in his Junior year, and Business Manager of the
Engineering Journal in his Senior year. He was graduated in 1889 with
the degree of C. E.

As a boy Mr. Deans was fond of games and all healthy outdoor sports.
He was a lover of Nature and of animals, fond of fishing and hunting,
and was never happier than when roaming the beautiful woods and
mountains of his native State. With such tastes it was natural to
find him, in his college days, a participator in, and an enthusiastic
supporter of, athletic games.

Not only in athletics, but in all things pertaining to Lehigh
University, Mr. Deans was a most loyal and enthusiastic son of his
Alma Mater, both at college and after he had gone out into the world.
He thoroughly appreciated the benefits derived from his technical
training, and was so eager that others should share them, that early in
his business career he advanced sufficient funds to two ambitious young
men to carry them through Lehigh.

Immediately after graduation Mr. Deans entered the employ of Sooysmith
and Company, the well-known foundation engineers and contractors. He
rapidly advanced to positions of responsibility with this company, and,
in 1895, became its Vice-President and Chief Executive Officer. When, a
year or two later, Charles Sooysmith, M. Am. Soc. C. E., retired from
active business, Mr. Deans organized, from the Sooysmith and Company
staff, the Engineering Contract Company, of which he became President.
Pressure of business seriously undermining his health, he was forced to
give up temporarily all work in 1900, and to spend the next two years
in the mountains of Northern Pennsylvania. On regaining his health, he
associated himself with the firm of John Monks and Son, of New York
City, and, at the time of his death, he was Second Vice-President of
that company.

While under his executive charge, both Sooysmith and Company and
the Engineering Contract Company, constructed a number of the most
important bridge foundations in the United States, and the former firm
first successfully introduced pneumatic work in the foundations of the
modern high office buildings of New York City, notably the Manhattan
Life, Washington Life, Standard Oil, and Empire Buildings on Lower
Broadway. At the time of his death, Mr. Deans was in full charge of the
building of the piers of the reconstructed Baltimore and Ohio bridge
over the Susquehanna River, at Havre de Grace, Md.

In the early years of his connection with Sooysmith and Company,
Mr. Deans was employed on work in the field, rising from subordinate
positions to that of Superintendent in responsible charge of work.
During this period he acquired an intimate and practical knowledge of
foundation construction, and his subsequent career gave evidence of
the value of this training. Being thus well-equipped, Mr. Deans soon
became notable as a business engineer. His judgment on all substructure
engineering problems was quick and keen, his thorough technical
knowledge being supplemented by his penetrating practical sense. His
business ability was of a high order, and his efficiency was largely
increased by his industry and methodical habits. As a negotiator, he
was in the first rank. His quick appreciation of the essentials in
business transactions, his fertile resource in the most complicated
financial dealings, his patience and persistence in the face of
discouragement or delay, and his inflexible determination when once his
decisions were reached, were qualities which placed him in the highest
rank as a contracting engineer. To those with whom he came in close
contact, Mr. Deans will always be remembered as exemplifying the ideal
combination of technical training with business efficiency.

He lightened the seriousness of his business transactions with a
quick sense of fun, a fondness for a good story, and an infectious
good humor. His genuine interest in the work of his associates and
his unfeigned delight in their success won him many friendships which
lasted throughout his life and which now keep his memory warm in the
hearts of those who were fortunate enough to know him intimately.
Strong of will, keen and clear-sighted in business transactions, loyal
to his friends and to the interests entrusted to him, he was, above
all, a genial, honorable, many-sided man, who loved his fellow men.

Mr. Deans leaves a mother, Mrs. Charles W. Deans, of Ph[oe]nixville,
Pa., a brother, John Sterling Deans, M. Am. Soc. C. E., Chief Engineer
of the Ph[oe]nix Bridge Company, and two sisters, Mrs. R. Barclay
Calley, of Seattle, Wash., and Mrs. Elmer E. Keiser, of Tacony, Pa.

In 1893, Mr. Deans married Miss Helen Arnold of West Chester, Pa., who,
with two sons, Charles Woodbury, aged 15, and Malcolm Arnold, aged 13,
survives him.

Mr. Deans was elected a Junior of the American Society of Civil
Engineers, on December 3d, 1890, and an Associate Member on May 6th,
1896.


=WILLIAM MEIER, Assoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E.=[4]

[4] Memoir prepared by William A. Theodorsen and E. James Fucik,
Associate Members, Am. Soc. C. E.

DIED FEBRUARY 14TH, 1910.

William Meier, the son of the Reverend Jacob L. and Mary Meier, was
born in Muscatine, Iowa, on April 10th, 1878, the family moving to
Chicago, Ill., in the same year.

Mr. Meier received his education in the public schools of Chicago and
at the University of Illinois, from which he was graduated in 1901,
with the degree of B. S. in Civil Engineering.

After his graduation, Mr. Meier was engaged with various firms,
principally in bridge and structural work. For a time he was with
William M. Hughes, M. Am. Soc. C. E., and in January, 1905, he entered
the service of the Scherzer Rolling Lift Bridge Company, as Assistant
in the Chicago office; and later was appointed Assistant Engineer and
Eastern Representative, with headquarters in New York City. At the time
of his death, Mr. Meier was employed in the Bridge Department of the
Chicago and North Western Railway.

On February 14th, 1910, in diving from a spring-board, in the
natatorium of the Young Men's Christian Association, he struck his head
against the side or bottom of the tank. When his body was taken from
the water, life was extinct, and all efforts at resuscitation were
futile.

Mr. Meier took great interest in all that pertained to his profession.

He was elected an Associate Member of the American Society of Civil
Engineers, on June 1st, 1909. He was also a Member of the Western
Society of Engineers.
